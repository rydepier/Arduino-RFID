# Arduino-RFID
This uses the MFRC522 Library. The UID of a card is read and if it is recognised a green LED is lit. Connecting pin 4 to ground, when the sketch first runs it enters a learning mode and the first card read becomes the master card.

The Original Library is included here, Credit to its Originator.
